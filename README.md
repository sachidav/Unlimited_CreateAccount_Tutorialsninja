unlimited Creat and Registration Account  Automation with Selenium and Apache POI
Welcome to the Registration Automation project! This repository contains a comprehensive example of automating user registration on a web application using Selenium WebDriver and Apache POI.

Features:

Selenium WebDriver: Utilized for browser automation, making it easy to interact with web elements.
Apache POI: Employs the Apache POI library to read from and write to Excel files, facilitating seamless data manipulation.
JavaFaker: Integrates the JavaFaker library to generate realistic random data for user registration.
Project Overview:

WebDriver Setup: The project uses WebDriverManager to set up and manage the ChromeDriver for browser automation.
Excel Interaction: Apache POI is employed to create an Excel workbook, generate a sheet named "UserData," and record registration details such as first name, last name, email, telephone, and password.
Random Data Generation: JavaFaker is used to populate the registration form with realistic and random data, ensuring a dynamic test scenario.
End-to-End Registration Flow: The script performs a complete registration flow, including form filling, submission, and additional page navigation.
Data Storage: The registration details are saved to an Excel file (file1.xlsx) for later analysis and verification.
